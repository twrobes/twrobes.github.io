		<h2 id="bio"><b>Bio</b></h2>
		<p>I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of St. Thomas in 2019.
		My passion for this subject is from learning about constantly developing 
		technologies and growing my problem solving skills. Tackling practical issues and
		creating solutions for businesses and for people cultivates a lot of meaning and
		purpose for me.

		covers. I have taken up baking as a new hobby and have had some delicious outcomes from it!
