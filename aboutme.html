		<p class="shadow">I'm a senior at the University of St. Thomas. Pursuing a B.A. in Computer Science, I enjoy learning about constantly developing 
		technologies and growing my problem solving skills. Some activities I currently enjoy are most watersports, video games, and 
		music. I play electric/upright bass for the school Jazz band and participate in several local bands and groups. Every so often
		I choose to jam on the guitar or even record covers. Recently baking has been a new hobby I have been trying out, and so far
		(most) of the results have been delicious!
